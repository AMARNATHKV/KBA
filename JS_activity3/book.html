    <p><span>William Shakespeare</span>(c. 23[a] April 1564 - 23 April 1616)[b] was an English 
    playwright, poet, and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in
    the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[4][5][6] He 
    is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").
    His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets,
    three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.
    His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed 
    more often than those of any other playwright.[7] Shakespeare remains arguably the 
    most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied
    and reinterpreted.</p>

    <p><span>Rabindranath Tagore </span>[1] 7 May 1861[2] 7 August 1941[3] was a Bengali poet, 
    writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer, and painter during 
    the age of Bengal Renaissance.[4][5][6] He reshaped Bengali literature and music
    as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th 
    centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of 
    Gitanjali,[7] he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to 
    win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual
    and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in 
    the Indian subcontinent.[9] He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. 
    Referred to as "the Bard of Bengal",[10][5][6] Tagore was known by sobriquets: 
    Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.</p>

    <p><span>William Wordsworth</span> 7 April 1770 - 23 April 1850 was an English Romantic poet who, 
    with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature 
    with their joint publication Lyrical Ballads (1798).
    Wordsworth's magnum opus is generally considered to be The Prelude, 
    a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years that he revised and expanded a number 
    of times. It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death, before which it was generally known as "the poem to Coleridge".
    Wordsworth was Poet Laureate from 1843 until his death from pleurisy on 23 April 1850.</p>
